# Goal

Track any subjectively note-worthy observations resulting from the one-ways analysis, in alphabetical order.

Note-worthy is split into two categories:
1. Importance/clear signal
2. Data quality issues

## Claim_Reparier_Approved
Note the typo in the column name
2. Clearly exhibits mid 2015 cutoff; likely older data was in different system. Call all times after this cutoff as 'modern' and before the cutoff as 'old'

1. Approved repairs and Non Approved are roughly same mean but Non approved much more variable
1. Unknown category still dwarfs everything - suspect this is just the missing data category. In this instance we can see stable and low mean relative to repairs that are filled in. I.e. presence of this data is likely biasing response up.

## Claim_Type
2. All claim types significantly less in 2020
2. W claim costs seem capped/thresholded from mid 2020 onwards; new policy?

1. F/T are both very rare but exhibit clearly higher overall average costs
1. W is significantly cheaper than everything else, 

## Claimant_DamageArea
